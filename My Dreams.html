      <p>
        My dream is to buy my parents a house and two cars for them. My goal is
        to be married at age of 22 or 23. My ideal future career is to be one of
        the biggest programmers or I.T consultants in the world. I would like to
        work for big companies like Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft or
        Facebook. But if I had to pick one it would be to work for Google. I
        hope to travel the whole world with my family. I would love to give back
        to my community, mostly my home country. A lot of people suffer around
        the world. People that have wealth think everything's okay but one day
        everything will be gone and they won't have anything. So everybody
        should give back even though you're not rich. My dream is to open a
        school in my home country and Food Market that's for free so the people
        that don't have money can just get some food.
